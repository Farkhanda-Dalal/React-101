#### Both pieces of code (default and named export) work in isolation, but their behavior changes depending on how the component is imported and used elsewhere in your React application. Here's a breakdown:

## Default Export:
```
import React from 'react'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>App</div>
  )
}
export default App;
```
- export default App; exports the App component as the default export from the file.
- When you import this component elsewhere, you can name the import whatever you want:
```
import App from './App';
// OR
import MyApp from './App';
```

Default exports are not tied to a specific name.

## Named Export:
```
import React from 'react'

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>App</div>
  )
}
```

- Export const App exports the App component as a named export.
- When you import this component elsewhere, you must use its exact name:
```
import { App } from './App';
```

-Named exports must be destructured using curly braces {} during import.

## Summary of the Difference:
- Default Export (export default): Import without curly braces, name can be arbitrary.
- Named Export (export const): Import with curly braces, name must match the exported name exactly.
