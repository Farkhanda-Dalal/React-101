### ðŸ”¸ **Main Differences:**

| Feature                          | CRA                                 | Vite                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Bundler**                      | Uses **Webpack**                    | Uses **ESBuild** (dev) + **Rollup** (prod) |
| **Startup Time**                 | Slower (bundles entire app upfront) | Instant (serves files on demand)           |
| **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** | Slower (reloads full app)           | Fast (reloads only the changed module)     |
| **Configuration**                | Hidden (needs eject to customize)   | Fully exposed via `vite.config.js`         |
| **Flexibility**                  | Opinionated, harder to modify       | Very flexible and modern                   |
| **Plugin Ecosystem**             | Based on Webpack                    | Modern plugin system, fast growing         |
| **Tailwind Integration**         | Slightly tricky                     | Very smooth and fast                       |
